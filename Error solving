this was the returned array from database..
Array ( [0] => Array ( [id] => 1016 [name] => paytm [slag] => paytm [click] => 11 ) )
I was trying to access the id like this 
$stores['id']

this was giving error like this
A PHP Error was encountered
Severity: Notice
Message: Undefined index: id

to solve this error i have done this..
$store[0]['id']
now its working correctly..
