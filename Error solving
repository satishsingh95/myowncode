this was the returned array from database..
Array ( [0] => Array ( [id] => 1016 [name] => paytm [slag] => paytm [click] => 11 ) )
I was trying to access the id like this 
$stores['id']

this was giving error like this
A PHP Error was encountered
Severity: Notice
Message: Undefined index: id

to solve this error i have done this..
$store[0]['id']
now its working correctly..


i was not getting the data from db due to lowercase and upper case mismatch in db and supplied value
so did this to get the correct value

You can lowercase the value and the passed parameter :

SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE LOWER(`Value`) = LOWER("DickSavagewood")



to make word in lower case use

strtolower($string)
to make first letter upper case use
ucfirst($string)
